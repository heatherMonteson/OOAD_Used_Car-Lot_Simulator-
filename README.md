OOAD examples outlined in Employee, Salesperson, Main, Intern and . 

Assumptions: 

-Unique salary for each employee is set in a range based on type so Intern has a daily salary that is set between $8.50 and $15 etc.
-When anything is bought, or employees are payed/given a bonus, the budget is checked in a bank. If any of the funds needed make the budget go to zero the bank adds 
emergency funding to the account before allowing funds to be removed.
