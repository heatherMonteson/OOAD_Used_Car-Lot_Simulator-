# Project 2.2 

Team members: Amandaliss Dropik, Heather Monteson

Java version: 11.0

OOAD examples outlined in Employee, Salesperson, Main, Intern, Vehicle and Car.

Assumptions:

-Unique salary for each employee is set in a range based on type so Intern has a daily salary that is set between $8.50 and $15 etc.

-When anything is bought, or employees are paid/given a bonus, the budget is checked in a bank. If any of the funds needed make the budget go to zero the bank adds emergency funding to the account before allowing funds to be removed.

-Outputting changes as they happen within areas of the program where those changes happen (output intern quit in the intern quitting function)

-Salary is based on ranges for each type of employee, not a fixed that is the same for each intern, salesperson and mechanic respectivly. 

-Each intern and mechanic can wash or fix any two cars a day even if it has already been washed/fixed
